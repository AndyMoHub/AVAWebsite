        <div class="method-content">
          <h2> Calculating Snow Plow Routes  </h2>   
          <p>We began our analysis by 
            finding the cost to clear a road. To get these results we first performed the analysis in ArcGIS Pro. In ArcGIS software We created a new field called "TotalPlowCost" under the feature class "ROAD_w_Lanes" and formulated this equation to determine the cost of snowplow routes. 
          <p>
            Formula: 
            TotalPlowCost = Number of Lanes * Road Length * (Cost per Meter to Run a Truck) * (Total # of Snow Plow Trips)

            <h2>Calculating Sewage Cost | Linear Referencing</h2>
            <p> In order to perform a network analysis, we figured out that we needed to do some linear referencing. Our first step began by creating centroids from each 
                parcel boundary
                We accomplished this by using the 'Feature to Point' geoprocessing tool in ArcGIS Pro. Next we created a model that linear references the centroids and the 
                sanitary discharge points

        <div class="methods-section">
            <h2>Calculating Sewage Cost | Separating Centroids</h2>
            <p>We had to optimize the centroids in order to perform the closest facility analysis. The initial centroid group consisted of approximately 26 000 points. 
                Therefore, we divided the centroids into six groups. Each group contains approximately 4500 points. To facilitate this process we used modelbuilder in 
                ArcGIS Pro using the select tool to split them up by objectID. 
            </p>
        </div>
                

        <div class="methods-section">
            <h2>Calculating Sewage Cost | Topology </h2>
            <p>We created topolgy rules for each feature dataset. Seven of the rules were assigned to the linear 
                network (sanitary/storm linear network) and two of them pertaining to the point layers. A model was created using Modelbuilder 
                to add these topology rules to each topology feature class in the sanitary and storm feature datasets. After these 
                rules were created, all topologies were validated.

        </div>
    


        <div class="methods-section">
            <h2>Calculating Sewage Cost | Closest Facility</h2>
            <p> To facilitate the closest facility analysis, we had to create a new network dataset for each 
                feature dataset. After the network dataset was created, the network properties 
                were modified to align with our objective of identifying the closest properties to each sewer 
                based on distance instead of other variables like drivetime. These modifications took place by 
                updating the travel mode name to 'Pipe' and the travel cost evaluator to 'Shape_Length.'
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the closest facility analysis, the sample property centroids were loaded in as the incidents 
                and the discharge points were loaded as the facilities. After the closest facility analysis was 
                run for each dataset, output routes were created which show the paths from the facilities 
                (discharge points) to the closest incident (property centroid). The amount of properties that 
                each sewer serviced and the cost of the pipe were calculated using various joins which will be 
                described in further detail in subsequent  sections.

                <h2>Final Joins and Calculations </h2>
                <p>The network analysis/closest facility established a connection between the parcel boundary and 
                    the sewage network. Consequently, we proceeded to establish a physical connection between the 
                    parcel and the existing sewage network. To facilitate this integration, we introduced new fields 
                    and performed calculations based on various factors. These included the relative tax associated 
                    with each parcel, the cost of pipe required relative to its length, and the number of homes that 
                    would be connected to each pipe.

        <div class="methods-section">
            <h2>Calculating Snow Plow Routes | Automation</h2>
            <p>We created a script that automates the entire process of getting the snow plow costs. It follows the same workflow as we did in ArcGIS Pro, 
                by first creating the new field in "ROAD_w_LANES." Moreover, the code is dynamic so the user can enter different numbers for "cost to 
                run a snow truck" and the "amount of snow trucks that go out anually." The Script also filters out roads that aren't maintained by the city. 
                In our case Peterborough does not maintain "Private (PRV)" roads. So our script ensures that PRV roads have a value of 0. Once the script finishes, 
                it should have successfuly created the new field, calculated the total snow plow cost and show the sum of the snow plow cost

            <h2>Calculating Sewage Cost | Automation</h2>
            <p>We created a script that automates the following processes; Linear Referencing, Splitting Centroids,
                Creating Feauture datasets, Topology Rules, Network Datasets, and Closest Facility. This was achieved 
                by exporting all the models created in modelbuilder as python files. We compiled the code together, 
                renamed variables and set filespaths to fit our geodatabase. We ensured that little hardcoding was required
                so that the user would only have to input their filepath to their geodatabase once and the whole script will run.
